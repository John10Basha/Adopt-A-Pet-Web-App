        <h3>Cat Care: Keeping Your Feline Happy and Healthy</h3>
        <p>
          Caring for a cat involves more than just feeding them and cleaning
          their litter box. It's about providing a comfortable, enriching
          environment that fosters their health and happiness. Here are some
          essential tips for proper cat care:

                A balanced diet is key to your cat's overall health. Choose
                high-quality cat food that suits their age, size, and health
                needs. Avoid feeding them human food, especially those that are
                harmful, like chocolate, onions, or grapes.

              <p>
                Cats need mental and physical stimulation to stay healthy.
                Interactive toys, scratching posts, and regular play sessions
                are excellent ways to keep them active. You can also set up safe
                outdoor time in a secure enclosure to satisfy their natural
                curiosity.

              <p>
                Regular grooming helps keep your cat's coat shiny and healthy.
                Brush long-haired cats daily to prevent tangles, and even
                short-haired cats benefit from weekly brushing. Bathe your cat
                only if necessary, using cat-friendly shampoo, and trim their
                nails regularly.

                Routine vet visits are crucial for your cat's health. Stay on
                top of vaccinations, flea and tick prevention, and dental care.
                If your cat shows any signs of illness, such as changes in
                eating habits or behavior, seek veterinary attention right away.

              <p>
                A clean litter box is essential for your cat's well-being. Scoop
                it daily and clean it with mild soap weekly. Keep it in a quiet,
                accessible spot and ensure it's big enough for your cat to move
                around comfortably.

                Cats sleep between 12 to 16 hours a day, so providing them with
                a quiet and cozy space to rest is important. A comfortable bed
                or designated resting area will help them feel secure.

                While cats can be independent, they still need companionship and
                love. Spend time petting, playing, and talking to your cat. Be
                mindful of their personality and respect their boundaries to
                ensure they feel safe and comfortable.

            By following these guidelines, you can ensure your cat enjoys a
            healthy, happy life as a beloved companion in your home.
